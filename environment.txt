Local Environment
		Devloper's dessktop.where devloper develop software in thier

Devlopment Environment
		Devlopment Environment is a platform which id devloped to specifically for developers. 
		Developers can develop or they can write up the codehere they can perform whitebox testing.
		Generally, it is accessed by developers for writing new lines of code as well as bug fixes. 
		The Devlopment server gives a run-time environment where the program developed and debugged.
		
Software Intigration Testing Environment
		The test engineers access it for conducting all the types of testing and also obtain by 
		developers for reproducing the bugs. In this server, we will perform the unit and integration testing.

User Acceptance Testing Environment
		We take another server to check the compatibility of the server because the production server 
		is highly configured, so we need a similar server where we can perform the system testing.
		This server helps us to identify the software performance, behavior, bugs, and other issues 
		before the application is deployed into the production server.

Production Environment
		The server, which consists of software, hardware, and the application development environment, 
		is known as the production server. It is a core server in which the users access any 
		web application or website. The production URL accesses the production server.
		Once the application is developed/tested/stable, then it is deployed into the production environment.
